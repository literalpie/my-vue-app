# Reusable Tanstack Table

This is just a POC/playground for trying out some ways to make a sharable component out of the tanstack table. It supports things like:

- Controlled or uncontrolled sorting state
- Modular components for setting filtering and column order state
- Custom features for flex-sizing of columns and adding actions to each cell
- Column resizing (cannot be used with flex-sizing)
- Virtual Scrolling
- A drop-in selection column
- A "Selection Actions" component that can perform actions on the currently selected rows
